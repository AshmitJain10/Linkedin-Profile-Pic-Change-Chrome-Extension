Greetings ,

I have created the chrome extension which changes the profile picture of all the accounts who have either posted or commented on the linkedin feed page.
I didn't have any prior knowledge on how to create an extension but then I read the resources you provided in the assignment and also went throught the documentation of chrome extensions.
The extension contains 5 files:
1. manifest.json - The manifest.json file tells Chrome about your extension, what it does, and the permissions it requires.
2. background.js - The background.js file can handle events and other background tasks.
3. content.js - The content.js file will manipulate the LinkedIn feed to change profile pictures.
4. styles.css - To add styles but in our extension it was not required. So, it is empty.
5. icon.png - Icon of the extension.
